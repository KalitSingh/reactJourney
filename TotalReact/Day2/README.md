# React + Vite

# Counter Application Notes:

Using how to use class component practically. 
Learn how to create a class Component and use their state object and this.setState() to update stored data in state. 

we can pass an object or callback function as an argumanet in the - this.setState() method. It is very similar to setterFunction(return by useState() hook) in the functional component.

Learn how to initialize state in class Component and how to update it. 

We always use this.setState() inside the function (it could be any event function) to update data in state based on Events.


# SpeedoMeter App Notes:

Learn how to use state in functional component. Basically it is useState(React Hook to manage state), we need to import it from "react". 

Learn how to initialize useState() it returns an array containing current value and setterFunction(to make updates or change in the state current value)

Here in the functional component we use setterFunction to update the state and its very similar to this.setState()

Best Practice to use a callback function inside the setterFunction(() => {...}) to update the state current value.
