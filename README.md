Welcome to my **React.js** learning repository!  
This repo tracks my daily progress as I build up skills in **React** — from scratch to advanced concepts — one day at a time. 🧠💻

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each day has its own folder for clean organization and easy navigation:

TotalReact
├── day1/ # 🚀 React setup, JSX basics
├── day2/ # 🔁 Components, Props, State, Events
├── day3/ # ♻️  Conditional Rendering
├── ...

📝 I’ll keep updating each day's folder with code and mini-projects.
